# fake-news-prediction
For the purpose of fake news prediction I have used Passive Aggressive Classifier.
Passive aggresive classifier is used for mostly large scale datasets because it takes input step by step rather than batch learning
where whole of dataset is taken at once.
# How passive aggressive classifier works
It works by remaining passive when a correct classification outcome takes place, but
it turns aggresive when wrong output is predicted on an example and therefore updates the classifier
and then throws away the example.
# Advantages of Passive Aggressive classifier
This classifier is extremely useful when we have immense amount of data and becomes highly difficult
to train the model using entire dataset at once. Passive Aggressive Classifier can take inputs step by
step and therefore gets the job without scaling CPU or any other hardware.
